                            Introduction
                            
                            Generative artificial intelligence (GenAl) represents a groundbreaking advancement in technology, capable of producing content such as text, images, and audio by leveraging large-scale data and neural networks. Tools like ChatGPT and DALL‚Ä¢E are rapidly gaining traction worldwide, particularly in educational and research contexts, where their applications hold significant promise. However, their swift adoption has raised pressing questions regarding regulation, ethical use, and integration into existing systems-particularly in countries like China, where both national laws and education-specific Al safeguards are still in the process of development.
                            
                            The "Generative Al in Education and Research Guidance" aims to address these challenges by offering a framework tailored to China's unique educational needs and legal landscape. It seeks to provide educators, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders with a roadmap to understand GenAl's capabilities and limitations, mitigate risks such as misinformation, data privacy concerns, and algorithmic biases, and ensure that its use aligns with ethical, cultural, and pedagogical values. The guidance emphasizes that while GenAl tools can revolutionize teaching, learning, and research, their transformative potential must be harnessed responsibly to protect educational integrity, preserve cultural diversity, and empower learners.
                            
                            This document is designed to navigate diverse aspects of GenAl's impact, including its technical workings, controversies arising from its use, and strategies for regulation and capacity building. Specifically, in the context of China, where education systems are deeply interwoven with cultural and societal values, the guidance promotes a human-centred approach to ensure that technology complements rather than supplants human agency. It also underscores the need for inclusive innovation, ensuring marginalized voices and diverse knowledge systems are supported within both traditional and technology-enhanced learning frameworks.
                            
                            The urgency of this guidance lies in the fact that GenAl adoption is outpacing the ability of educational systems, especially in China, to respond effectively. To address this gap, the document provides actionable steps for regulating GenAl use, capacity building for teachers, researchers, and students, and strategies for co-designing educational applications that are pedagogically sound and culturally sensitive. Looking ahead, this framework also includes reflections on how GenAl may reshape education and research over the long term, offering insights into future challenges and opportunities.

                            3. Regulating the Use of Generative AI in Education  
                            
                            The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI) technologies in education presents significant opportunities for innovation but also raises serious challenges related to ethics, transparency, bias, and potential misuse. To ensure that GenAI is used responsibly and constructively within educational systems, a robust regulatory framework is essential. This chapter provides a detailed roadmap for regulating GenAI use in education, emphasizing a human-centred approach, multi-stakeholder involvement, and adherence to ethical and cultural values, especially in the context of China‚Äôs evolving legal and policy landscape.
                            
                            3.1 A Human-Centred Approach to AI  
                            Regulation of GenAI must prioritize the protection of human agency, dignity, and creativity. Educational applications of GenAI should enhance the teaching and learning process without diminishing the autonomy of educators or students. A human-centred approach emphasizes:
                            - Supporting human decision-making rather than replacing it.
                            - Upholding fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in all uses of GenAI.
                            - Promoting cultural diversity and local values within China‚Äôs education system.
